            <h2>How NomNoms works:</h2>
            <p>NomNoms allows you to create vegan recipes using our database of food subtitutions or "noms".</p>
            <h3>If you can't find what you need for your recipe?</h3>
            <p>NomNoms allows you to manually add ingredients from other sources found online.</p>
            <h3>Why NomNoms?</h3>
            <p>While you can certainly create your own lists and recipes of vegan substitutions, NomNoms provides a space in which to collect all of those links and brands and countless other things that are often difficult to keep track of.</p>
            <h3>A NomNoms for all</h3>
            <p>Though NomNoms was designed with vegans in mind, this app can also be used to sub out meat, dairy or other foods that you may need to stop eating due to medical or lifestyle changes. Or maybe, you just need a <i>break</i> from a particular food and are looking for a plant-based alternative.</p>
            <p>In other words, <b>you don't have to be vegan to eat vegan</b>.</p>
